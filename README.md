# Machine Learning Projects - Regression in Healthcare

Welcome to the **ML Projects** repository, where I showcase a series of machine learning projects primarily focused on **regression techniques** in the **healthcare domain**. These projects utilize a variety of **scikit-learn** models and other popular machine learning libraries to predict and analyze healthcare-related outcomes. Each project includes real-world datasets that help demonstrate the application of machine learning for healthcare problems.

## Overview

In this section, I provide a collection of regression projects that aim to solve healthcare challenges using machine learning. The goal of these projects is to apply various regression techniques to predict key metrics such as disease progression, patient risk factors, and other critical healthcare parameters. Through these projects, I have explored multiple regression models and evaluation techniques that are essential for real-world healthcare data analysis.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Cancer Detection**: Using regression to predict tumor sizes or malignancy scores in cancer detection models.
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicting disease progression in diabetes patients.
- **Heart Disease Risk Prediction**: Estimating the severity of heart disease based on various health parameters.
- **Hospital Length of Stay**: Predicting the length of hospital stays based on patient demographics and health data.
- **Blood Pressure Prediction**: Forecasting blood pressure levels based on lifestyle and health factors.

## Projects

Here are the main regression projects in healthcare that you’ll find in this module:

### 1. **Breast Cancer Detection (Regression)**
- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.
- **Objective**: Predict cancer tumor size or malignancy risk.
- **Libraries Used**: `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- **Regression Model**: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression

### 2. **Diabetes Progression Prediction**
- **Dataset**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
- **Objective**: Predict the progression of diabetes in patients over a year.
- **Libraries Used**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- **Regression Model**: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR)

### 3. **Heart Disease Severity Prediction**
- **Dataset**: Heart Disease UCI Dataset.
- **Objective**: Predict the risk level or severity of heart disease based on medical features.
- **Libraries Used**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `seaborn`
- **Regression Model**: Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting

### 4. **Hospital Length of Stay (LOS) Prediction**
- **Dataset**: Hospital patient records (various public datasets).
- **Objective**: Predict the number of days a patient will stay in the hospital.
- **Libraries Used**: `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- **Regression Model**: Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression

### 5. **Blood Pressure Prediction**
- **Dataset**: Public health datasets (e.g., blood pressure and health metrics).
- **Objective**: Predict blood pressure levels based on factors like age, BMI, and lifestyle.
- **Libraries Used**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- **Regression Model**: Linear Regression, SVR, Lasso Regression

## Libraries and Technologies Used
- **scikit-learn**: The primary library for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing data and model performance.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running any of the projects, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Project Structure
/regression/: Contains all the healthcare regression projects.
/cancer_detection.py: Cancer detection regression model.
/diabetes_prediction.py: Diabetes progression prediction model.
/heart_disease_prediction.py: Heart disease risk prediction model.
/hospital_stay_prediction.py: Hospital length of stay prediction model.
/blood_pressure_prediction.py: Blood pressure prediction model.
Model Evaluation

Each project includes model evaluation steps, using various metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R² (Coefficient of Determination)
These metrics will give you insights into the accuracy and performance of each model.

### Steps to Fix Formatting:

1. **Headers**: Ensure you're using `#` for headers. For example, `# Machine Learning Projects - Regression in Healthcare`.
2. **Bold Text**: Use `**` around text that should be bold. For example, `**ML Projects**` or `**scikit-learn**`.
3. **Lists**: Use `-` or `*` for bulleted lists, like `- Cancer Detection` or `- Diabetes Prediction`.
4. **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) to denote code blocks, as I did for the `pip install` command or for Python code snippets.

After fixing this, **commit** your changes, and GitHub should render the Markdown properly with the correct formatting (bold, headers, etc.).

Let me know if you run into any further issues!
